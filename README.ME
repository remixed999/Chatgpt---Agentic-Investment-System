# ChatGPT – Agentic Investment System

## Overview

The **ChatGPT – Agentic Investment System** is a **design-first, multi-agent portfolio analysis and governance framework**.

It is built to support **auditable, reproducible, and risk-aware investment decision support** at the **portfolio level**, using AI agents *only* for structured reasoning and orchestration — never for opaque or uncontrolled decision logic.

All decision-affecting logic is explicitly defined through schemas, governance rules, and penalty engines **before any code is written**.

This repository currently contains **High-Level Design (HLD)** and **Detailed Design artifacts only**.
No implementation, automation, or trading logic exists yet.

---

## Core Design Philosophy

This system is intentionally designed around the following principles:

* **Design before build**
  No implementation occurs until schemas, contracts, and governance rules are formally specified and approved.

* **Separation of concerns**
  AI reasoning is isolated from deterministic logic to avoid probabilistic drift.

* **Portfolio-first, not ticker-first**
  The system evaluates portfolios as coherent risk systems, not independent stock picks.

* **Auditability and reproducibility**
  Every decision must be explainable, traceable, and reproducible from inputs.

* **Governance over optimization**
  The system prioritizes constraint enforcement and risk control over raw scoring.

## 3-Layer Architecture

The system follows a strict **three-layer architecture**:

### Layer 1 — Directives (What to Do)

* Human-readable SOPs written in Markdown
* Define goals, constraints, inputs, outputs, and edge cases
* Live in the `directives/` directory
* Treated as authoritative instructions

### Layer 2 — Orchestration (Decision-Making)

* AI-assisted reasoning and routing
* Applies directives, evaluates conditions, sequences agents
* Produces structured outputs only (no free-form decisions)
* Responsible for vetoes, short-circuiting, and escalation

### Layer 3 — Execution (Doing the Work)

* Deterministic scripts (planned: Python)
* Handles data processing, calculations, validation, and enforcement
* No business logic is invented at this layer
* Fully testable and auditable

> **Key rule:**
> AI agents never implement logic — they only interpret and apply explicitly defined rules.

## What This System Is **Not**

* ❌ Not an automated trading bot
* ❌ Not a stock-picking AI
* ❌ Not a backtesting engine
* ❌ Not a performance-promise system

This is a **decision-support and governance framework**, not a signal generator.

## Design Artifacts (Detailed Design Phase)

The Detailed Design phase produces the following artifacts **before any build work is permitted**:

1. **Schema Specifications**
   Exact field-level definitions and invariants

2. **Data Contracts**
   Input/output contracts between agents and orchestration

3. **Orchestration State Machine**
   Deterministic execution flow and failure handling

4. **Penalty Engine Specification**
   Penalty categories, magnitudes, and application rules

5. **Governance Rules**
   Veto logic, precedence, and hard stops

6. **Canonicalization Specification**
   Reproducibility and hash equivalence rules

7. **Error Handling & Failure Semantics**
   FAILED vs VETOED vs SHORT_CIRCUITED definitions

8. **Test Fixture Specifications**
   Golden inputs/outputs for validation

Only after all artifacts are complete and approved does implementation begin.

---

## Intended Future Tooling (Not Yet Implemented)

* Python for deterministic execution
* Schema validation and enforcement layers
* Portfolio-level scoring and aggregation
* Human-in-the-loop review points

All tooling decisions are deferred until design exit criteria are met.

---

## Contribution & Change Control

* Design documents are **authoritative**
* Changes require explicit approval
* No undocumented assumptions allowed
* All ambiguities must be surfaced as design decisions

This repository prioritizes **correctness over speed**.
