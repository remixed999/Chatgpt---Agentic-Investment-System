# Final Closure & Traceability Report
## Agentic Investment System

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Overall conclusion:** The system’s core architecture, governance, determinism, and orchestration flow are implemented and documented, but closure readiness is **not fully substantiated** due to conflicting deployment evidence (Phase 2 status mismatch) and observed design-to-implementation gaps (noted below).【F:hld/HLD_v1.0.md†L272-L357】【F:detailed_design/DD-04_ORCHESTRATION_FLOW.md†L1-L214】【F:detailed_design/DD-06_GOVERNANCE_RULES.md†L1-L207】【F:detailed_design/DD-07_CANONICALIZATION_SPEC.md†L1-L202】【F:delivery/PHASE_PLAN.md†L1-L79】【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase2/summary.json†L1-L16】
- **Fit for purpose:** **Accepted with conditions** pending resolution of deployment-phase evidence conflicts and remediation of identified gaps (Sections 7–9).【F:delivery/PHASE_PLAN.md†L1-L79】【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase2/summary.json†L1-L16】

## 2. Original Scope & Intent
- The system is defined as a **portfolio-first, multi-agent risk assessment system** that outputs PortfolioCommitteePacket, HoldingPacket(s), and FailedRunPacket, with auditability and governance enforcement as first-class objectives.【F:hld/HLD_v1.0.md†L272-L333】
- Non-goals explicitly exclude automated trading, real-time streaming, and multi-tenant SaaS concerns; scope remains decision-support with deterministic, auditable outputs.【F:hld/HLD_v1.0.md†L274-L299】
- Requirements coverage (R1–R20) enumerates the authoritative intent for scoring, provenance, governance, determinism, and portfolio operation semantics, serving as the baseline for traceability in Section 4.【F:hld/HLD_v1.0.md†L3-L27】

## 3. Architecture & Design Alignment
- The HLD establishes portfolio-first orchestration and multi-agent governance; DD-01 through DD-08 formalize schemas, contracts, orchestration flow, governance rules, canonicalization, and guard rails in an integrated stack.【F:hld/HLD_v1.0.md†L272-L357】【F:detailed_design/DD-01_SCHEMA_SPECIFICATIONS.md†L1-L165】【F:detailed_design/DD-03_AGENT_INTERFACE_CONTRACTS.md†L1-L212】【F:detailed_design/DD-04_ORCHESTRATION_FLOW.md†L1-L214】【F:detailed_design/DD-06_GOVERNANCE_RULES.md†L1-L207】【F:detailed_design/DD-07_CANONICALIZATION_SPEC.md†L1-L202】【F:detailed_design/DD-08_ORCHESTRATION_GUARDS.md†L1-L212】
- DD-10 and DD-11 define strict test-gated promotion and deterministic deployment phases, binding delivery and operational readiness to evidence artifacts and replay validation.【F:detailed_design/DD-10_TEST_STRATEGY.md†L1-L200】【F:detailed_design/DD-11_PHASED_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md†L1-L199】
- DD-12 registers deployment risk controls aligned to DD-11 and guard enforcement, reinforcing determinism and governance enforcement expectations at runtime.【F:detailed_design/DD-12_DEPLOYMENT_RISK_REGISTER.md†L1-L172】

| R8 Standard disclosure (disclaimers/limitations) | HLD §0.1 R8 | DD-01 (packet specs in HLD) | Portfolio/holding limitations are emitted based on governance outcomes; explicit disclaimers fields are not present in core packet schemas (gap vs HLD disclosure intent).【F:hld/HLD_v1.0.md†L14-L15】【F:hld/HLD_v1.0.md†L314-L333】【F:src/aggregation/aggregator.py†L34-L203】【F:src/core/models/schemas.py†L201-L217】 | Deployment evidence does not explicitly attest to disclosure fields; no artifacts reference disclaimers. | Partial (limitations only; disclaimers not evidenced). |
| R9 Currency + exchange support | HLD §0.1 R9 | DD-01 | Holding identity in core schemas lacks exchange/currency fields; HoldingInput includes `currency` but not `exchange` (gap vs DD-01 InstrumentIdentity).【F:hld/HLD_v1.0.md†L15-L16】【F:detailed_design/DD-01_SCHEMA_SPECIFICATIONS.md†L79-L104】【F:src/core/models/schemas.py†L29-L64】 | No deployment evidence of exchange/currency enforcement beyond base_currency guard. | Partial (exchange missing in core identity schema). |
| R10 Base currency normalization | HLD §0.1 R10 | DD-08 | G1 guard vetoes missing base_currency; orchestrator handles portfolio-level veto outcomes.【F:hld/HLD_v1.0.md†L16-L17】【F:detailed_design/DD-08_ORCHESTRATION_GUARDS.md†L59-L69】【F:src/core/guards/guards_g0_g10.py†L74-L83】【F:src/core/orchestration/orchestrator.py†L131-L165】 | Phase 1 guard enforcement evidence present.【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase1/attestation.md†L29-L32】 | Aligned. |

| R15 Burn-rate classification input | HLD §0.1 R15 | DD-05 | RunConfig includes burn_rate_classification; penalty engine uses it to adjust missing cash/runway penalties.【F:hld/HLD_v1.0.md†L21-L21】【F:detailed_design/DD-05_PENALTY_ENGINE_SPEC.md†L71-L75】【F:src/core/models/schemas.py†L79-L88】【F:src/core/penalties/penalty_engine.py†L81-L106】 | Phase 1 tests passed; no dedicated deployment evidence. | Aligned (implementation), deployment evidence partial. |
| R16 Reproducibility canonicalization | HLD §0.1 R16 | DD-07 | Canonicalization and hashing implemented; determinism guard checks ordering and idempotence; hashing computed in aggregation for completed outcomes.【F:hld/HLD_v1.0.md†L22-L23】【F:detailed_design/DD-07_CANONICALIZATION_SPEC.md†L37-L189】【F:src/core/canonicalization/canonicalize.py†L21-L157】【F:src/core/canonicalization/hashing.py†L16-L115】【F:src/core/guards/guards_g0_g10.py†L243-L270】【F:src/aggregation/aggregator.py†L183-L200】 | Phase 1 deterministic replay evidence present; Phase 2 summary reports hash mismatch and skipped determinism tests (blocking).【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase1/attestation.md†L23-L28】【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase2/summary.json†L1-L16】 | Aligned (implementation), deployment status conflicted. |

## 5. Implementation Conformance Review
- **Conformant implementations:** Orchestration flow, governance precedence, canonicalization/hashing, guard registry, and penalty engine are implemented and wired into the orchestrator and aggregation layers, consistent with DD-04/05/06/07/08, and support deterministic run outputs with hashes for COMPLETED outcomes.【F:detailed_design/DD-04_ORCHESTRATION_FLOW.md†L1-L214】【F:detailed_design/DD-05_PENALTY_ENGINE_SPEC.md†L1-L173】【F:detailed_design/DD-06_GOVERNANCE_RULES.md†L16-L167】【F:detailed_design/DD-07_CANONICALIZATION_SPEC.md†L37-L189】【F:detailed_design/DD-08_ORCHESTRATION_GUARDS.md†L14-L212】【F:src/core/orchestration/orchestrator.py†L47-L695】【F:src/core/governance/engine.py†L32-L177】【F:src/core/canonicalization/canonicalize.py†L21-L157】【F:src/core/canonicalization/hashing.py†L16-L115】【F:src/core/guards/registry.py†L1-L34】【F:src/core/penalties/penalty_engine.py†L48-L214】【F:src/aggregation/aggregator.py†L76-L203】
- **Scope deviations (implementation vs design):**
  - **G3 staleness guard is stubbed** (returns pass), meaning DD-08 staleness guard behavior is not enforced at guard level; reliance shifts to DIO outputs and penalty engine (partial coverage).【F:detailed_design/DD-08_ORCHESTRATION_GUARDS.md†L100-L119】【F:src/core/guards/guards_g0_g10.py†L117-L122】【F:src/core/penalties/penalty_engine.py†L109-L119】
  - **InstrumentIdentity lacks exchange/currency fields** in core runtime schema (only holding_id/ticker/identifier), diverging from DD-01’s InstrumentIdentity contract; HoldingInput includes currency but not exchange, leaving exchange validation unimplemented.【F:detailed_design/DD-01_SCHEMA_SPECIFICATIONS.md†L79-L104】【F:src/core/models/schemas.py†L29-L64】
  - **Unit consistency and explicit disclaimer fields** are not represented in core runtime schemas; HLD disclosure intent appears only as limitations in aggregation logic, not explicit disclaimers in packet schemas.【F:hld/HLD_v1.0.md†L314-L333】【F:detailed_design/DD-01_SCHEMA_SPECIFICATIONS.md†L135-L152】【F:src/aggregation/aggregator.py†L34-L203】【F:src/core/models/schemas.py†L201-L217】
- **Implementation scope completion claims:** Delivery plan states IMP-01 through IMP-06 are complete, but this is a repository assessment rather than a verified deployment signal; it should be treated as supportive but not definitive for closure without phase evidence alignment.【F:delivery/PHASE_PLAN.md†L1-L79】

## 6. Determinism & Governance Assurance
- **Designed guarantees:** DD-07 mandates canonicalization, sorted ordering, excluded fields, and hash rules; DD-06 and DD-08 define governance precedence and guard enforcement as non-bypassable, deterministic gates.【F:detailed_design/DD-07_CANONICALIZATION_SPEC.md†L37-L202】【F:detailed_design/DD-06_GOVERNANCE_RULES.md†L16-L167】【F:detailed_design/DD-08_ORCHESTRATION_GUARDS.md†L14-L212】
- **Implementation alignment:** Canonicalization and hashing are implemented, with determinism guard checking ordering and idempotence; governance precedence is enforced in GovernanceEngine and G6 guard logic, with orchestrator enforcing emission eligibility and hash requirements for COMPLETED outcomes.【F:src/core/canonicalization/canonicalize.py†L21-L157】【F:src/core/canonicalization/hashing.py†L16-L115】【F:src/core/guards/guards_g0_g10.py†L243-L270】【F:src/core/governance/engine.py†L32-L177】【F:src/core/orchestration/orchestrator.py†L239-L695】
- **Residual issues:** G3 staleness guard is not implemented; DD-08 intended guard coverage is therefore incomplete and should be treated as a determinism/governance control gap until remediated or explicitly deferred.【F:detailed_design/DD-08_ORCHESTRATION_GUARDS.md†L100-L119】【F:src/core/guards/guards_g0_g10.py†L117-L122】

## 7. Deployment Lifecycle Compliance (DD-11)
- **Phase 0:** Attestation exists and is PASSED with config bundle completeness and hash checks; aligns with DD-11 Phase 0 exit criteria evidence requirements.【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase0/phase0_attestation.md†L1-L11】【F:detailed_design/DD-11_PHASED_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md†L22-L50】
- **Phase 1:** Attestation is PASSED with unit/contract/determinism/governance evidence and replay artifacts; aligns with DD-11 Phase 1 gates.【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase1/attestation.md†L1-L32】【F:detailed_design/DD-11_PHASED_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md†L53-L81】
- **Phase 2:** **Conflict detected** — attestation says PASSED, but summary.json reports FAILED with hash mismatch, forbidden runtime patterns, and skipped determinism/governance tests. This violates DD-10/DD-11 gating requirements and must be resolved before closure.【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase2/attestation.md†L1-L17】【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase2/summary.json†L1-L16】【F:detailed_design/DD-10_TEST_STRATEGY.md†L1-L10】【F:detailed_design/DD-11_PHASED_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md†L84-L113】
- **Phase 3:** Attestation exists and indicates PASSED, but Phase 2 failure status undermines the stated entry criteria; evidence chain is inconsistent with DD-11’s dependency rules.【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase3/attestation.md†L1-L38】【F:detailed_design/DD-11_PHASED_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md†L116-L143】
- **Phase 4:** Production rollout attestation indicates PASSED with production run artifacts, determinism replay, governance trail, and rollback evidence; however, upstream Phase 2 conflict must be resolved to validate promotion legitimacy.【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase4/phase4_attestation.md†L1-L36】【F:detailed_design/DD-11_PHASED_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md†L145-L169】
- **Phase 5:** Post-deployment attestation indicates PASS with determinism drift and observability evidence; again, dependent on resolving Phase 2 gating conflict for authoritative compliance.【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase5/summary_attestation.md†L1-L10】【F:detailed_design/DD-11_PHASED_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md†L172-L198】
- **Plan vs evidence mismatch:** The Phase Plan states Phase 2 failed and Phases 3–5 not started, which contradicts the presence of phase attestations in release manifests; this mismatch prevents formal closure without reconciliation.【F:delivery/PHASE_PLAN.md†L1-L79】【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase3/attestation.md†L1-L38】【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase4/phase4_attestation.md†L1-L36】【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase5/summary_attestation.md†L1-L10】

## 8. Gaps, Deviations & Accepted Constraints
- **G3 Staleness Guard not enforced** (DD-08 requires staleness/hard-stop guard behavior; implementation is currently a pass-through). **Status:** Requires Future Work.【F:detailed_design/DD-08_ORCHESTRATION_GUARDS.md†L100-L119】【F:src/core/guards/guards_g0_g10.py†L117-L122】
- **InstrumentIdentity contract mismatch** (exchange/currency missing in runtime HoldingIdentity; exchange not validated). **Status:** Requires Future Work.【F:detailed_design/DD-01_SCHEMA_SPECIFICATIONS.md†L79-L104】【F:src/core/models/schemas.py†L29-L64】
- **Unit consistency field absent** (MetricValue `unit` not present in runtime schemas, limiting unit consistency enforcement). **Status:** Requires Future Work.【F:detailed_design/DD-01_SCHEMA_SPECIFICATIONS.md†L135-L152】【F:src/core/models/schemas.py†L41-L56】
- **Disclosure fields not explicit** (HLD references disclosure/limitations; runtime schemas only include limitations without explicit disclaimers). **Status:** Accepted with Notes (if disclosure policy is intentionally limited to limitations) or Requires Future Work if disclaimers are mandatory. 【F:hld/HLD_v1.0.md†L314-L333】【F:src/aggregation/aggregator.py†L34-L203】【F:src/core/models/schemas.py†L201-L217】
- **Deployment phase evidence conflict** (Phase 2 PASS vs FAILED; Phase 3–5 attestations exist despite Phase 2 failure). **Status:** Requires Future Work (evidence reconciliation).【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase2/attestation.md†L1-L17】【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase2/summary.json†L1-L16】【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase3/attestation.md†L1-L38】【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase4/phase4_attestation.md†L1-L36】【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase5/summary_attestation.md†L1-L10】

## 9. Operational Readiness & Residual Risk
- **Runnable without developers:** A CLI entrypoint exists for local deterministic runs using a release bundle, which supports operational execution with predefined inputs, but production operations are gated on unresolved DD-11 evidence conflicts.【F:src/cli/run_local.py†L11-L54】【F:delivery/PHASE_PLAN.md†L1-L79】
- **Auditable and replayable:** Canonicalization, hashing, and RunLog outputs are implemented; Phase 1 replay artifacts show deterministic equivalence. Phase 2 evidence conflict and skipped tests introduce residual audit risk until resolved.【F:src/core/canonicalization/hashing.py†L16-L115】【F:src/core/orchestration/orchestrator.py†L72-L695】【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase1/attestation.md†L23-L28】【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase2/summary.json†L1-L16】
- **Observable and diagnosable:** Governance trail and guard outputs are embedded in PortfolioCommitteePacket, and Phase 4/5 attestations reference observability artifacts; still dependent on reconciling deployment phase contradictions.【F:src/aggregation/aggregator.py†L168-L179】【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase4/phase4_attestation.md†L19-L33】【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase5/summary_attestation.md†L6-L10】
- **Safe to operate long-term:** Governance precedence and penalty sequencing are implemented; however, staleness guard enforcement gaps and identity schema mismatches represent residual risk requiring remediation or formal acceptance. **Residual risk: Medium** until addressed.【F:detailed_design/DD-06_GOVERNANCE_RULES.md†L16-L167】【F:src/core/governance/engine.py†L32-L177】【F:src/core/guards/guards_g0_g10.py†L117-L122】【F:src/core/models/schemas.py†L29-L64】

## 10. Final Closure Verdict
- **ACCEPTED WITH CONDITIONS** — Closure is contingent on resolving DD-11 Phase 2 evidence conflicts, addressing guard/schema gaps (or formally accepting them), and confirming disclosure expectations. The current evidence base does not fully satisfy DD-10/DD-11 promotion rules and therefore cannot support unconditional closure.【F:detailed_design/DD-10_TEST_STRATEGY.md†L1-L10】【F:detailed_design/DD-11_PHASED_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md†L84-L113】【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase2/summary.json†L1-L16】

## 11. Formal Closure Statement
- **Date (UTC):** 2026-02-07
- **Authority declaration:** As Independent Architecture, Delivery, and Governance Assurance Authority, I confirm that this closure assessment is based solely on repository evidence and authoritative design/phase documents, and it is issued in an audit-ready, scope-contained manner.【F:hld/HLD_v1.0.md†L272-L357】【F:detailed_design/DD-11_PHASED_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md†L1-L199】【F:release_manifests/dd11-phase1/attestation.md†L1-L32】
